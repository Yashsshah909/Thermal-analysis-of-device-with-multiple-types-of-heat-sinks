# Thermal-analysis-of-device-with-multiple-types-of-heat-sinks

This is a project that I did during my co-op at Raymond corporation. 
Stress test is being used on an embedded linux device that is used as a smart monitor on forklifts. 

Different types of passive heat-sinks are then attached to the device's circuit board to find out which works the best.
